# BlackOut

This game was developed by MSYNC.

This a Unity developed 3-D video game that aims to teach second to fifth grade students about circuits and renewable energy sources such as wind, water, and solar. This is a prototype that only focues on wind energy. The game follows a child named Stanley who stumbles into the Wind City, Cyclone. A storm has turned off all the power from Cyclone and the wind robots need help to turn the power back on. 

The first demo shows the puzzle part of the game after Stanley has collected the parts necessary. The player must then build a closed-circuit from an electric tower to a turbine ir in order to bring the power back.

The second demo shows the introduction of the game where the player meets Faustos, the first robot. He tells Stanley what controls he can use to move around. Faustos proceeds to tell Stanley about how Cyclone's power had gone out and asks Stanley to help.

The third demo is where Stanley meets Blyth, the second robot, who will tell him what it is that he needs to do to help out Cyclone and its wind robots.
